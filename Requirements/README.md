                                      REQUIREMENTS FOR TIC-TAC-TOE GAME

LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
		Tic-tac-toe is a two player game (one of them being your computer program). The two players take turns putting marks on a 3x3 board. The player who first gets 3 of his/her marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game, and the other loses the game.
HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS:
C Language:
	For this Tic-Tac-Toe Game we are using C Language.
	C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development. 
Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from the C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on the C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (Few programs may compile in C, but not in C++).
The Unix operating system and virtually all Unix applications are written in the C language. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons.
•	Easy to learn
•	Structured language
•	It produces efficient programs.
•	It can handle low-level activities.
•	It can be compiled on a variety of computers.


Visual Studio Code:
	Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity). Begin your journey with VS Code with these introductory videos.
Doxygen Documentation:
	Doxygen  is a documentation generator and static analysis tool for software source trees. When used as a documentation generator, Doxygen extracts information from specially-formatted comments within the code. When used for analysis, Doxygen uses its parse tree to generate diagrams and charts of the code structure. Doxygen can cross reference documentation and code, so that the reader of a document can easily refer to the actual code.
Makefile:
	Makefiles are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are compiled. Other languages typically have their own tools that serve a similar purpose as Make. It can be used beyond programs too, when you need a series of instructions to run depending on what files have changed.
MINGW:
	Mingw-w64 is an advancement of the original mingw.org project, created to support the GCC compiler on Windows systems. It has forked it in 2007 in order to provide support for 64 bits and new APIs. It has since then gained widespread use and distribution.
The development and community are very active and welcoming with new contributors every month and simple installers.
